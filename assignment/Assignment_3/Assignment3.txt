                 CHAPTER 3: WEBSITE STRUCTURE DESIGN

Group A: Short Questions (2 Marks)                 

1. Define Information Architecture (IA).
 = Information Architecture (IA) is the process of organizing, structuring, and labeling information on a website or application so that users can easily find, understand, 
   and navigate the content.

2. What is a "Wireframe"?
 = A wireframe is a basic visual blueprint of a webpage that shows the layout, structure, and placement of elements (such as menus, buttons, and content areas) without 
   focusing on colors, graphics, or styling.

3. Explain the concept of "Cognitive Friction" in web design. 
 = Cognitive friction refers to the mental effort required by users to understand or use a website. Poor navigation, unclear labels, or complex layouts increase cognitive 
   friction and make users feel confused or frustrated.

4. Why should URL slugs use hyphens instead of underscores? 
 = Hyphens improve readability and SEO because search engines treat hyphens as word separators, while underscores are not recognized as spaces, making URLs harder to read 
   and index.

5. Compare and contrast Hierarchical (Tree) structure and Linear (Sequential) structure.Give an example of when to use each.
 = Hierarchical (Tree) structure and Linear (Sequential) structure are two common methods used to organize information on a website. In a hierarchical structure, information is 
   arranged from broad categories to more specific subcategories, forming a tree-like pattern. This structure allows users to navigate freely between different sections and is 
   highly suitable for large and complex websites. It improves usability by helping users understand the relationship between different pages. For example, a university website 
   may have a main homepage that leads to faculties, then departments, and finally individual courses.
 = A linear structure presents information in a fixed, step-by-step order where users must follow a predefined sequence. This structure is simple and easy to understand but
   offers limited navigation flexibility. It is best used for small websites or processes that require a specific order, such as online exams, tutorials, or checkout processes.
    In comparison, hierarchical structure supports scalability and complex content organization, whereas linear structure ensures controlled navigation and guided user experience.

6. Explain the ”Three-Click Rule” and its significance in User Experience (UX) design.
 = The Three-Click Rule is a usability principle which states that users should be able to find any information on a website within three mouse clicks. If users require more 
   than three clicks to reach their desired content, they may become frustrated and leave the website. The main purpose of this rule is to encourage designers to create simple, 
   well-organized, and intuitive navigation systems. In terms of user experience design, the Three-Click Rule highlights the importance of reducing effort and saving users’ time. 
 
   When information is easily accessible, users feel more comfortable and confident while browsing the website. This rule also helps in lowering bounce rates, increasing user
   engagement, and improving overall satisfaction. Although it is not a strict rule and some users may tolerate more clicks if the navigation is clear, it serves as an important
   guideline to focus on simplicity and user-centered design.

7. "Plan before you do".Explain how tools like Card Sorting and Flowcharts help in planning a website’s structure.
 = The statement “Plan before you do” emphasizes the importance of proper planning before starting website development, and tools such as Card Sorting and Flowcharts play a 
  vital role in this process. Card sorting is a technique in which content items are written on cards and users are asked to group them in a way that makes sense to them. This
  helps designers understand users’ mental models and expectations, making it easier to create logical menus and navigation structures. Flowcharts, on the other hand, provide a
   visual representation of how users move through a website, showing page sequences, decision points, and user interactions. They help designers visualize user journeys, 
   identify potential confusion, and eliminate unnecessary steps. Together, card sorting and flowcharts ensure that the website structure is clear, organized, and user-friendly,
    reducing errors during development and improving overall user experience.


Group C: Scenario-Based Questions (5 Marks)

8. You are designing a website for a University. It has hundreds of pages (Admissions, Departments, Alumni, News). Which structural model would you choose? Draw a rough diagram and justify your choice.
 = When designing a website for a university that contains hundreds of pages such as admissions information, academic departments, alumni resources, and news updates, the most 
   suitable structural model is the Hierarchical (Tree) Structure. A university is a complex organization, and users visiting the website may have very different goals, such 
   as prospective students looking for admission details, current students searching for departments, alumni seeking updates, or the general public reading news. A hierarchical 
   structure organizes information from general to specific levels, making it easier for users to locate the required content without confusion.

    In this structure, the homepage acts as the root, and major sections branch out into subcategories. Each category can further divide into more detailed pages. This method 
    supports scalability, meaning new departments, programs, or notices can be added without disrupting the existing structure. It also matches the mental model of users, as 
    educational institutions are naturally organized into faculties and departments.

    Rough Diagra :
    Home
    ├── Admissions
    │    ├── Undergraduate
    │    ├── Postgraduate
    │    ├── Scholarships
    ├── Departments
    │    ├── Science
    │    │     ├── Computer Science
    │    │     ├── Physics
    │    ├── Management
    ├── Alumni
    │    ├── Events
    │    ├── Donations
    ├── News & Announcements

   In conclusion, the hierarchical structure is ideal for a university website because it ensures logical organization, easy navigation, efficient information retrieval, and 
   long-term maintainability, resulting in a positive user experience.

9. A user visits a website but leaves within 10 seconds because they cannot find the navigation menu, which is hidden behind a small icon on a desktop screen. Analyze this design failure using the ”KISS” (Keep It Simple) principle.  
 = This scenario clearly highlights a violation of the KISS principle, which stands for “Keep It Simple, Stupid.” The KISS principle emphasizes that a design should be simple, 
   obvious, and easy to understand, especially for first-time users. In this case, hiding the main navigation menu behind a small icon on a desktop screen increases complexity 
   and creates confusion for users.

   Desktop users typically expect the navigation menu to be clearly visible at the top or side of the screen. While hidden menus (such as hamburger icons) are acceptable on 
   mobile devices due to limited screen space, using the same approach on desktop screens is often unnecessary and harmful. The user, unable to immediately locate the navigation
    menu, experiences increased cognitive friction. As a result, the user feels lost, frustrated, and decides to leave the website within a few seconds.

   This design failure negatively impacts usability, accessibility, and user trust. It also increases the bounce rate and reduces engagement, which are harmful for both
    business goals and SEO performance. A simple and visible navigation menu would have allowed the user to understand the site structure instantly and explore further.

   In conclusion, by ignoring the KISS principle, the designer made the interface unnecessarily complicated. Following KISS would mean displaying a clear, visible navigation 
   menu on desktop screens, reducing user effort, improving satisfaction, and ensuring users stay longer on the website.

10. An e-commerce website has a URL structure like www.shop.com/prod?id=55&cat=9. Explain why this is bad for both users and Search Engines (SEO), and propose a better structure using Page Slugs.
 = The given URL structure www.shop.com/prod?id=55&cat=9 is an example of a poorly designed URL that is bad for both users and search engines. From a user’s perspective, this
   URL provides no meaningful information about the content of the page. Users cannot determine what product the page represents, making the link difficult to remember, trust,
    or share. Such URLs appear technical and unprofessional, reducing user confidence.

  From an SEO perspective, search engines prefer clean, readable, and keyword-rich URLs. Dynamic URLs with random parameters like id=55 and cat=9 do not contain descriptive 
  keywords, making it harder for search engines to understand and rank the page properly. These URLs also reduce click-through rates in search results because users are more
  likely to click on links that clearly describe the content.

  A better solution is to use page slugs, which are short, descriptive, and human-readable text added to the URL. For example:"www.shop.com/electronics/mobile-phones/samsung-galaxy-s23"
  This improved structure clearly describes the product and its category. It is user-friendly, easy to remember, and SEO-optimized due to the inclusion of relevant keywords. 
  In conclusion, using page slugs improves usability, enhances search engine visibility, increases trust, and provides a better overall user experience for an e-commerce website.
