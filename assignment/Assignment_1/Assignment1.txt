GROUP A :  SHORT QUESTION ANSWER [2 Marks]

1. Define term "Protocol" in the context of Internet.
 = A protocol is a standard set of rules and formats that govern how data is structured ,addressed transmitted and received between devices,allowing 
 them to communicate universally, much like a common language.

2. What is the primary difference between a Web Browser and a Search Engine?
 = A web browser is the software you use to access and view the internet's content,acting a your gateway.It is an  application program installed on
    your device (phone, computer).
   A serch engine a website/service within the browser that helps you find information by serching its index of the web.It is a  web-based tool or
    service, not an installed program.

3. Define the World Wide Web (WWW).
 = The WWW is the collection of websites and web pages that you view using the Internet.It uses URLs to locate resources, HTTP/HTTPS to transfer 
    data, and HTML to display content such as text, images, videos, and links.

4. Distinguish between a static web page and a dynamic web page.
 = A static web page delivers or show the same information to every user,functioning much like a document that is presented as is.
 = A dynamic web page is capable of displaying different content based on user interaction,time or other changing data.

5. Explain the client-server architecture of the web with a neat diagram.
 = The client-server architecture of the web is a computing model where the client requests resources or services from a centralized server, which
     then provides those resources or services in a request-response cycle.The client requests services, and the server provides them, enabling web communication.
  
   
   +-----------+        HTTP Request        +-----------+
|  Client   | ------------------------> |  Server   |
| (Browser) |                            | (Web/App) |
|           | <------------------------ |           |
+-----------+        HTTP Response       +-----------+

6. Describe the functions of the following Internet services: Email, FTP, and VoIP.
 =
  Email(Electronic Mail)is the service for sending and receiving digital messages over the Internet.its functions are as follow.
 . Used to send and receive electronic messages over the Internet.
 . Supports text, images, documents, and attachments.
 . Allows fast, low-cost communication worldwide.
 . Example: Gmail, Yahoo Mail, Outlook.

  FTP(File Transfer Protocol)is a standard network protocol used to transfer computer files from one host to another over a TCP/IP-based network.
    its function are as follow.
 . Used to upload and download files between a client and a server.
 . Helps in sharing large files over the Internet.
 . Commonly used by web developers to upload website files to servers.
 . Example: FileZilla, WinSCP.
 
  VoIP(Voice over IP) is a technology that allows voice communication and multimedia sessions (such as video) to be conducted over Internet Protocol
   (IP) networks, rather than the traditional Public Switched Telephone Network.its main function are as follow.
 . Used to make voice and video calls using the Internet instead of telephone lines.
 . Converts voice signals into digital data.
 . Provides low-cost or free communication.
 . Example: Skype, WhatsApp, Zoom.

7. "The Internet is a network of networks".Elaborate on this statement explaining how
   packet switching works.
 = The statement “The Internet is a network of networks” means that the Internet is not a single network owned or controlled by one organization. 
    Instead, it is a global collection of many smaller networks that are interconnected and communicate using common protocols like TCP/IP.
   Following are the step by step process of how packet switching works.
   
  1. Data is divided into packets.
    . When you send data (email, web page, video), it is broken into small packets.
    . Each packet contains:
       1. part of the data
       2. source addresse
       3. destination address
       4. swquence number

  2. Packets travel independently.
    . Packets may take different paths across different networks.
    . Routers decide the best available route for each packet.

  3. Routing through networks.
    . Packets pass through multiple routers and networks (ISPs, backbone networks).
    . If one path is busy or fails, packets are rerouted automatically.

  4. Reassembly at destination.
    . At the destination, packets are reassembled in correct order using sequence numbers.
    . Missing or damaged packets are retransmitted (handled by TCP).

 8. A startup company wants to host a website that displays the same information to all visitors and requires very low maintenance costs. However, 
    they are being advised to use a dynamic website. As a consultant, would you agree? Justify your answer.
  = As a consultant, I would not agree with the advice to use a dynamic website for this requirement.Because The startup wants a website that 
    display the same information to all visitor and has the low maintanance costs which clearly matches the characteristics of a static website. 
    Static websites are built using basic technologies like HTML and CSS and do not require server-side scripting or databases. This makes them 
    easier to develop, cheaper to host, and simpler to maintain, as there are fewer security risks and technical updates to manage. Additionally, 
    static websites load faster and are more reliable because they have fewer dependencies.On the other hand, dynamic websites are designed for
     situations where content needs to change frequently or be customized for different users. They rely on databases and server-side processing, 
     which increases development complexity, hosting costs, and ongoing maintenance. Since the startup does not need personalized or frequently 
     changing content, using a dynamic website would add unnecessary cost and effort without providing any practical advantage. Therefore, a 
     static website is the more appropriate and cost-effective solution for the company’s needs.


 9. A user types www.google.com into their browser, but the browser displays a "Server Not Found"error, even though the internet connection is 
    active. However, accessing the site via 142.250.190.46 works. Diagnose the problem and explain the underlying technology that failed.
  = The issue occurs due to a failure of the Domain Name System (DNS). When a user types www.google.com into a browser, the browser does not
   directly connect to the website. Instead, it first sends a request to a DNS server to translate the domain name into its corresponding IP 
   address, which is needed to locate the web server on the Internet. In this case, the DNS lookup failed, so the browser could not find the 
   server and displayed a “Server Not Found” error, even though the internet connection was active. When the user accessed the site using the IP 
   address 142.250.190.46, it worked because the DNS translation was bypassed, and the browser could connect directly to Google’s server. This 
   indicates that the DNS service, responsible for resolving domain names to IP addresses, either had a temporary outage, was misconfigured, or 
   the user’s device had incorrect DNS settings. Thus, the underlying technology that failed in this scenario is the DNS system.
  
10. A multinational corporation wants to share sensitive inventory data with specific suppliers but does not want this information available to the
     general public. Explain which network type (Intranet, Extranet, or Internet) they should implement and why.
 = The multinational corporation should implement an Extranet to share sensitive inventory data with specific suppliers. An extranet is a private
  network that extends part of a company’s internal network to selected external users, allowing controlled access to specific information while 
  keeping it secure from the general public. Unlike the Internet, which is accessible to everyone, an extranet provides a restricted and secure 
  environment, ensuring that only authorized parties, such as suppliers or business partners, can access the shared data. Unlike an intranet, 
  which is limited to internal employees, an extranet enables collaboration with external entities without compromising security. By using an 
  extranet, the corporation can safely share inventory information, control who can view or modify the data, and maintain confidentiality, making 
  it an ideal solution for secure business communication with specific external partners.
